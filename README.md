# Project Orthomus
 Software made for testing and control of Project Orthomus (including relevant libraries)

Project Orthomus was made for the purpose of providing people with muscular dystrophy with an additional means to complete an arm flexion/extension motion. The idea is that the user can press the "Up" or "Down" buttons to incrementally change the position of the arms. The first prototype functioned as a display model only, the design still had to be adapted to use on an actual person.

I apologise for the disorganised nature of this repository, I was brand new to GitHub when I created it. The documentation process was also lacking during this project due to time constraints, but enough data can be used from this repository to create the project again if need be. It was a very useful learning experience.
